# How to Remember Everything

## 1. Active Recall => Samurai Approach to memory

<!-- our memory strenghtens through output therefore recollecting information stored in the brain is a way of enforcing the brain to build long term memory [i.e builds strong mental connections]
How to practice this is to rewrite what has been studed without looking at the study material.

## 2. The Kuman method => Learning in small powerful steps.

<!-- Broke studies into small manageable steps. this method encourages daily bite-sized learning, reinforcing concepts gradually instead of overloading the mind with information in a day.

small consitent improvement daily

## 3. Spaced Repetition => The gardening technique for our brain

<!-- Refresh memory before they fade. Review material 30mins, 1hour, 24hours, 72hours then a week. Each time we review materials our memory gets sharper and stronger. but instead of going over the study material, try to use the samurai approach [recall from memory without looking at the material first.] -->

## 4. Kaizen principle => 1% daily improvement

<!-- The Kaizen principle continuous improvement through small consistent steps. 1% improvement compounds into massive progress overtime.

This avoid burnout.

## 5. Suuu => The Art of Focus

<!-- Suuu is a state of deep focus where we become one with our task. this create a level of concentration that signal to the brain it's time to learn.

This is like turning studies or learning into a ritual. -->
